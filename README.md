# Healthcare-Inequality-Website
Personal Project trying to raise awareness on healthcare inequality in the USA.

Personal project I worked on during the school semester in my free time to familiarize myself with and get a better understanding of webdev/front-end work. Use of CSS and Javascript to make a website that tries to raise awareness on how healthcare is delivered to different socioeconomic groups and how patient outcomes change as a result.
